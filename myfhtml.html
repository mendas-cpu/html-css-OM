            Lyrics
        </h3>
        <pre style="border: 3px solid;">
            <b>You leapt from crumbling bridges watching cityscapes turn to dust
            Filming helicopters crashing in the ocean from way above

            Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
            Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
            You've been locked in here forever, and you just can't say goodbye

            Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers wrapped in your arms
            You've been hiding them in hollowed-out pianos left in the dark

            Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
            Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
            You've been locked in here forever, and you just can't say goodbye

            Your lips, my lips
            <button> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sElE_BfQ67s&ab_channel=CigarettesAfterSex" target="_blank">Apocalypse</a> </button>
            Your lips, my lips
            <button> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sElE_BfQ67s&ab_channel=CigarettesAfterSex" target="_blank">Apocalypse</a> </button>
            
            Go and sneak us through the rivers
            Flood is rising up on your knees
            Oh, please
            Come out and haunt me
            I know you want me
            Come out and haunt me

            Sharing all your secrets with each other since you were kids
            Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you clutched in your fist

            Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
            Got the music in you, baby, tell me why
            You've been locked in here forever, and you just can't say goodbye
            You've been locked in here forever, and you just can't say goodbye

            Ooh-oh
            When you're all alone
            I will reach for you
            When you're feeling low
            I will be there too</b>
